Howdy, and thanks for your interest in PyICQt! The purpose of this transport is to provide a way for users to be logged into ICQ via their Jabber account. It is implemented in Python, using the Twisted framework. This project has gotten fairly mature since it's start. However, there are still a lot of qwirks here and there to work out. Don't be afraid to submit bug reports, feature requests, or to post general questions either on the following:
