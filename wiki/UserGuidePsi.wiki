#summary User guide: Psi and PyICQt

First, you should have a jabber account. Have no one? It's free to register at one of [http://www.jabberes.org/servers/ servers] (also, check features, supported by this server)

Ok. You are registered at jabber server and it has an ICQ transport:

Log-in and execute Service Discovery for your server:

I use local test server for transports and will hide all its URLs :)
See ICQ transport in disco results? Then register at it:

Type your UIN and password:

You are registered at the transport. Now you should Auth it and wait for some seconds while transport is logging into ICQ network.
ICQ users will be added to roster automatically:

It's already possible to post messages to your friends. But, of course, PyICQt can do more. These 'additional' features are available via _Ad-Hoc_ commands:

Default settings are applied to your account after registration. Check them:

For example, I enabled x-status support:
