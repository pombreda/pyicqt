#summary Transport monitoring

You have perfect jabber server and transports installed, all stuff works, but you have not enough information about current status of a platform?

This page can made your life a bit better.

How monitor entire system? Better solution - choose special product for monitoring. For example, [http://munin.projects.linpro.no/ Munin]. It's a monitoring application, accessible via web interface with modular architecture. 

If your server is ejabberd, you can get [http://muninexchange.projects.linpro.no/?search&cid=10&pid=103&phid=144 plugin] for it. You already can monitor server.

Transport monitoring. I don't found plugins for this, but in most cases it's not a problem. You run transport under separate user, right? Then we can just view statistics for it!

Since 0.8.1b3 PyICQt contains Munin plugins for monitoring of memory consumption and threads counting "out-of-box". You can get them from /tools directory.

How to use:
  * Install Munin :)
  * Put *memory_* and *threads_* scripts to /usr/share/munin/plugins directory (check your path)
  * Make them executable
  * Create symlinks in into /etc/munin/plugins (if you run PyICQt under pyicqt user, names should be a *memory_pyicqt* and *threads_pyicqt*)
  * Add to /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/munin-node file lines:

{{{
[memory_*]
user root

[threads_*]
user root
}}}

It's all. Now you should restart munin-node and look result at http://localhost/munin/ (in basic case):
