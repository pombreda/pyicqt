#summary Switching between different transport versions

== 0.8 -> 0.8.1 ==

If you use MySQL as XDB backend, after upgrade you will get exception `"Table 'pyicqt.csettings' doesn't exist"`. Reason - some tables were added and used in new version.
Necessary manually create these tables.
_tools/db-setup.mysql_ file contains required commands. You should run mysql client and execute script like:
{{{
mysql --host=localhost --user=pyicqt --password=pyicqt pyicqt
mysql> \. db-setup.mysql
}}}
